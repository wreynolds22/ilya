     <h2><b>A Review of HTML</b></h2>
     <p>HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements
        that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters. <br> The best part of HTML is that once we know
        how to effectively use basic elements, we can now look up how to use all of the others!

    <h4><b><u>Headings</u></b></h4>
    <h1>This is a size "1"</h1>
    <h2>This is a size "2"</h2>
    <h3>This is a size "3"</h3>
    <h4>This is a size "4"</h4>
    <h5>This is a size "5"</h5>
    <h6>This is a size "6"</h6>

    <h4><b><u>Lists</u></b></h4>
    <p>
    Below is an example of a nested-list, using both an ordered list and an unordered list:
    <ol>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Third</li>
    <ul><li>3rd Place
        <li> Tres</li> </ul>
    <li>Fourth</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h4><b><u>Links</u></b></h4>
    <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages,
        both within and outside of the current website <br><br> For instance,
        they can quickly direct users to <a href="Google.com">Google's Homepage</a>. <br><br>
        <a href=mailto:wreynolds@student.mamkschools.org>Emails</a> can also be
        easily sent through the use of links.<br><br>
        <a href="#top">They can even bring user to a certain place within a webpage.</a>

    <h4><b><u>Images</u></b></h4>
    <div align="right"> <p>Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text.
        Using the "align" atribute, with a value of "left" is a <br> perfect way to do
        this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the
        value in the "align" attribute to the "right".</p></div>
